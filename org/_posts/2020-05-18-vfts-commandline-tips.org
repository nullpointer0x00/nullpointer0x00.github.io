I'm a Linux user that *loves* the commandline.  However, my current job is .net development on windows mostly.  We use TFS as our current repository and instead of Git the one I'm used to.  The GUI interface in Visual Studio was just not cutting it for me anymore. So, I started researching the TF windows commandline tool.

Show pending files in repository
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
#equivelent to 'git status' of current working directory
tf status 
#status of a workspace from absolute path
tf status c:\someworkspace\ /recursive
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
tf get
#+END_SRC

To check file differences us the *tf diff*.  However, you will want to set the /format: to 
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
#Show diffs of all files starting at the current working directory
tf diff /format:unix /recursive .
#Or show diffs of everything in specific folder
tf diff /format:unix /recursive c:\SomeProjectFolder
#Or just a file
tf diff /format:unix d:\SomeProjectFolder\program.cs
#+END_SRC

Checking in files...
#+BEGIN_SRC shell

#+END_SRC
